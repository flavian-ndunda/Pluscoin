# Pluscoin
This is a crypto currency that was initiated by Flavian Ndunda in 2018 at Taita Taveta University.Pluscoin was inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto the founder of blockchain technology.Pluscoin is folk from Peeercoin in which In order to  facilitate the computation of coin  age,  we introduced a timestamp  field into 
each  transaction.  Block  timestamp  and  transaction  timestamp  related  protocols  are 
strengthened to secure the computation of coin age. 
 
Proof-of-Stake 
 
Proof-of-work  helped  to  give  birth  to  Nakamoto’s  major  breakthrough,  however  the 
nature  of  proof-of-work  means  that  the  crypto-currency  is  dependent  on  energy 
consumption,  thus  introducing  significant  cost  overhead  in  the  operation  of  such 
networks, which is borne by the users via a combination of inflation and transaction fees. 
As  the  mint  rate  slows  in  Bitcoin  network,  eventually  it  could  put  pressure  on  raising 
transaction  fees  to  sustain  a  preferred  level  of  security.  One  naturally  asks  whether  we 
must  maintain  energy  consumption  in  order  to  have  a  decentralized  crypto-currency? 
Thus it is an important milestone both theoretically and technologically, to demonstrate 
that  the  security  of  peer-to-peer  crypto-currencies  does  not  have  to  depend  on  energy 
consumption. 
 
A concept termed proof-of-stake was discussed among Bitcoin circles as early  as 2011. 
Roughly  speaking, proof-of-stake  means a  form  of  proof of ownership of the currency. 
Coin  age  consumed  by  a  transaction  can  be  considered  a  form  of  proof-of-stake.  We 
independently  discovered  the  concept  of  proof-of-stake  and  the  concept  of  coin  age  in 
October 2011, whereby we realized that proof-of-stake can indeed replace most proof-of-
work’s functions with careful redesign of Bitcoin’s minting and security model. This  is 
mainly  because,  similar  to  proof-of-work,  proof-of-stake  cannot  be  easily  forged.  Of 
course,  this  is  one  of  the  critical  requirements  of  monetary  systems  -  difficulty  to 
counterfeit. Philosophically speaking, money is a form of ‘proof-of-work’ in the past thus 
should be able to substitute proof-of-work all by itself.
